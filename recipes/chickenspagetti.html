    <h1>Quick and Easy Chicken Spagetti</h1>
    <img src="../img/chicken.png" alt="chickenspagetti">

    <p>Quicky, easy, and good. In Texas, I was taught to also add a can of Cream of Mushroom to the recipe.<br> I also learned that 
        Velveeta is the favorite to use since it melts so well.
         Some people drain the Rotel, and some don't. (It's spicier if you keep the liquid though). Either way is good to me.
         I know a few people who use canned chunked chicken (like canned tuna, but chicken) to make it that much quicker to make.
